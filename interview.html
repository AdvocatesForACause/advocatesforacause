        <h3>What is depression?</h3>
        <div class="a1">
          <p>Depression (major depressive disorder or clinical depression) is a common but serious mood disorder. It causes severe symptoms that affect how you feel, think, and handle daily activities, such as sleeping, eating, or working. To be diagnosed with depression, the symptoms must be present for at least two weeks.
Some forms of depression are slightly different, or they may develop under unique circumstances, such as:
-    Persistent depressive disorder
-    Postpartum depression
-    Psychotic depression
-    Seasonal affective disorder</p>
<div class="q2">
  <h3>What are the symptoms of depression?</h3>
  <div class="a2">

  </div>
  <p>If you have been experiencing some of the following signs and symptoms most of the day, nearly every day, for at least two weeks, you may be suffering from depression:
    -       Persistent sad, anxious, or “empty” mood
    -       Feelings of hopelessness, or pessimism
    -       Irritability
    -       Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, or helplessness
    -       Loss of interest or pleasure in hobbies and activities
    -       Decreased energy or fatigue
    -       Moving or talking more slowly
    -       Feeling restless or having trouble sitting still
    -       Difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions
    -       Difficulty sleeping, early-morning awakening, or oversleeping
    -       Appetite and/or weight changes
    -       Thoughts of death or suicide, or suicide attempts
    <div class="q3">
      <h3>How is depression treated?</h3>
      <div class="a3">
        Depression, even the most severe cases, can be treated. The earlier that treatment can begin, the more effective it is. Depression is usually treated with medications, psychotherapy, or a combination of the two. If these treatments do not reduce symptoms, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and other brain stimulation therapies may be options to explore.
Here are other tips that may help during treatment for depression:
    -       Try to be active and exercise.
    -       Set realistic goals for yourself.
    -       Try to spend time with other people and confide in a trusted friend or relative.
    -       Try not to isolate yourself, and let others help you.
    -       Expect your mood to improve gradually, not immediately.
    -       Continue to educate yourself about depression.

          <h3>How dangerous is depression?</h3>
          <div class="a4">
            <p>Depression is the cause of over two-thirds of the 30,000 reported suicides in the U.S. each year.  Untreated depression is the number one risk for suicide among youth. Suicide is the third leading cause of death in 15 to 24 year olds and the fourth leading cause of death in 10 to 14 year olds. Young males age 15 to 24 are at highest risk for suicide, with a ratio of males to females at 7:1.</p>
            <div class="q5">
              <h3>Can depression lead to other mental health issues?</h3>
              <div class="a5">
                <p>No, but in midlife or older adults, can co-occur with other serious medical illnesses, such as diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and Parkinson’s disease.</p>
<div class="q6">
  <h3>What age group does depression occur in?</h3>
  <div class="a6">
    <p>Depression can happen at any age, but often begins in adulthood. Depression is now recognized as occurring in children and adolescents, although it sometimes presents with more prominent irritability than low mood. Many chronic mood and anxiety disorders in adults begin as high levels of anxiety in children.</p>
    <div class="q7">
      <h3>What are factors leading to depression?</h3>
    <div class="a7">
      <p>Depression can be triggered by a life crisis, physical illness or something else—but it can also occur spontaneously. Scientists believe several factors can contribute to depression:
-       Trauma. When people experience trauma at an early age, it can cause long-term changes in how their brains respond to fear and stress. These changes may lead to depression.
-       Genetics. Mood disorders, such as depression, tend to run in families.
-       Life circumstances. Marital status, relationship changes, financial standing and where a -person lives influence whether a person develops depression.
-       Brain changes. Imaging studies have shown that the frontal lobe of the brain becomes less active when a person is depressed. Depression is also associated with changes in how the pituitary gland and hypothalamus respond to hormone stimulation.
-       Other medical conditions. People who have a history of sleep disturbances, medical illness, chronic pain, anxiety and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are more likely to develop depression. Some medical syndromes (like hypothyroidism) can mimic depressive disorder. Some medications can also cause symptoms of depression.
-       Drug and alcohol abuse. Approximately 30% of people with substance abuse problems also have depression. This requires coordinated treatment for both conditions, as alcohol can worsen symptoms.</p>
<div class="q8">
  <h3>How many people get depression in a year?</h3>
  <p>An estimated 16 million American adults—almost 7% of the population—had at least one major depressive episode in the past year. People of all ages and all racial, ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds experience depression.</p>
